            80 days around the world, we’ll find a pot of gold just sitting where the <br>
            rainbow’s ending. Time — we’ll fight against the time, and we’ll fly on the <br>
            white wings of the wind. 80 days around the world, no we won’t say a <br>
            word before the ship is really back. Round, round, all around the world. <br>
            Round, all around the world. Round, all around the world. Round, all around <br>
            the world.
